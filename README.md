# Includes machine vision projects for the EE 576 Machine Vision Course

The project descriptions, reports and instructions are on the project folders.

Project 1 : 
This project is for basic operations on OpenCV. When you run the code, it ask a valid number to open the related image in the dataset. 
The 2x2 grid includes the original image, rotated image in the first two cell. When the user presed left button with mouse, the selected region 
will apper on the other cells.

Project 2 : 
This project is for calculating the Homography Map using 2 images. When you run the code, it ask a valid number to open the related image in the dataset. 
The 2x2 grid includes the original image, next image in the dataset on the first two cell. When the user presed left button with mouse, the selected region 
will apper on the other cells.

Project 3 : 
The goal of this project is to make you work with Ô¨Ånding segments in an image and deriving their represen-
stations. 

Project 4 : 
The goal of this project is to work with object representation, learning and recognition.
Consider the Washington RGB-D dataset.

Project 5 : 
The project aims to familiarize with OpenCV image reading, showing and interaction.
